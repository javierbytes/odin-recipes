      <h3>How to The Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Heat the oven to 400ºF.</b> <br />
          Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400°F.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Brown the beef and onion.</b> <br />Finely chop 1 medium yellow
          onion. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch or larger regular or
          cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the
          onion, 1 pound lean ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4
          teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and cook, breaking the beef up
          into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until the beef is cooked
          through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 5
          minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Prepare the baking dish and assemble the meat sauce.</b> <br />
          Open 1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups). Spread a thin
          layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir the
          remaining sauce into the ground beef mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Begin layering the lasagna.</b> <br />
          Shred 12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese if needed (3 cups).
          Place 5 lasagna noodles in the baking dish, breaking them if needed to
          create a single layer (it’s OK if the noodles overlap slightly).
          Dollop and spread 1 cup of the ricotta cheese over the noodles. Dollop
          and spread about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce on the ricotta, then
          sprinkle with 1 cup of the mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Continue layering the lasagna.</b> <br />
          Arrange 5 more noodles over the mozzarella, followed by 1 cup of the
          ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce, and 1 cup of the
          mozzarella. Top with a final layer of 5 noodles and the remaining
          sauce, spreading the sauce thin so that it almost completely covers
          the noodles. (Reserve the remaining 1 cup mozzarella for the end of
          baking.) Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bake the lasagna for 1 hour.</b><br />
          Bake for 1 hour. Check to make sure the noodles are done by poking the
          lasagna with a knife; the knife should slide easily through all the
          layers. If it doesn't, cover and cook for 15 minutes more.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and finish baking.</b>
          Uncover the lasagna and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella.
          Bake uncovered until the mozzarella is melted and lightly browned, and
          the sauce is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes more.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Cool the lasagna for 15 minutes.</b> <br />
          Let the lasagna cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before
          serving.
